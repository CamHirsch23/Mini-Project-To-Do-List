1. Setting Up

Create a new Python file named todo_app.py to start the development of the To-Do List application. This step sets the foundation for the project by establishing a dedicated file for the codebase.
2. Menu Display

Implement a display_menu() function to show options to the user. This function will present the available actions (e.g., add task, view tasks, mark task as done, delete task, quit) and prompt the user to select an option 
.
3. Adding Tasks

Create an add_task(tasks) function to add new tasks to the list. This function will prompt the user for a task description and append the task to the list 
.
4. Viewing Tasks

Implement a view_tasks(tasks) function to display all tasks with their indices. This function will iterate through the list of tasks and print each task's description 
.
5. Marking Tasks as Done

Create a mark_task_done(tasks) function to remove completed tasks. This function will allow the user to select a task by its index and mark it as done, typically by removing it from the list or updating its status 
.
6. Main Program Logic

Implement the main() function to handle user input and call appropriate functions based on the user's choice. This function will serve as the entry point of the application, managing the flow of the program 
.
7. Save and Load Tasks

Add save_tasks(tasks) and load_tasks() functions for data persistence. These functions will handle saving the list of tasks to a file and loading tasks from a file, respectively, ensuring that task data is preserved between sessions
.
8. Editing Tasks

Implement an edit_task(tasks) function to modify existing tasks. This function will allow the user to select a task by its index and update its description and due date.
9. Adding Due Dates

Modify the task structure to include due dates. This enhancement involves updating the task data model to store both the task description and its due date, providing more context and organization for the tasks.
10. Creating a GUI

Use Tkinter to create a graphical interface for the application. This step involves setting up the main window, adding widgets (e.g., buttons, entry fields, listboxes), and defining methods for task operations to create a user-friendly interface 
.
