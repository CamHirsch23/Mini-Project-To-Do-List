Allow users to interact with the application by selecting menu options using input(). Implement input validation to handle unexpected user input gracefully 
.
4. Error Handling

Implement error handling using try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle potential issues 
.
5. Code Organization

Organize your code into functions to promote modularity and readability. Use meaningful function names with appropriate comments and docstrings for clarity 
.
6. Testing and Debugging

Thoroughly test your application to identify and fix any bugs. Consider edge cases, such as empty task lists or incorrect user input 
.
7. Documentation

Include a README file that explains how to run the application and provides a brief overview of its features 
.
8. Optional Features (Bonus)

If you feel adventurous, you can add extra features like task priorities, due dates, or color-coding tasks based on their status
